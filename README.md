# TekTok

## Description

Welcome to Tek Tok! (Not to be confused with Tik Tok). We got our start in the Spring of 2024 when four individuals from all over the US found themselves paired up while enrolled in a full-stack coding program at the University of Minnesota. Through late night discussions, laughter, tears, and an idea that it would be great to have a social-media site for programmers; Tek Tok was born. Thanks for checking us out!

When users first come to the site, they will get to see posts made by other users as well as the 'Coding Joke of the Day'.
![Homepage when not logged in](Screenshot goes here)

Users without accounts will also have access to the links that are in the footer. Because we are a small group with no funding yet, some of our pages will say 'Coming Soon from the Creators of Tek Tok'.

If users try to navigate to a page that requires them to be logged in, they will be redirected to the signup/login page where they can create an account.
